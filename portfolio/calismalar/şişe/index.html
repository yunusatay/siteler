            <p class="sağ-p">Staying hydrated is an elusive goal we’re all trying to perfect <br> but, for one reason or
                another, are
                rarely achieving. Why is it <br> so hard despite well-documented health benefits? Drinking <br> eight
                glasses of
                water a day has been shown to flush out <br> toxins, prevent headaches, boost your energy levels,
                improve <br>
                your cardiovascular health, keep your skin clear, lubricate <br> your joints, stimulate your muscles,
                and
                promote weight <br> loss. Yet most of us don’t come anywhere close to hitting the <br> recommended
                levels of water
                intake each day.</p>

            <p class="grikutu-p">The DrinKup water bottle uses a high-tech smart lid to track your water intake
                throughout the day. It logs the time and number of ounces you drink in an easy-to-read companion app
                while the lid itself has a screen which displays your current stats. In addition to tracking when and
                how much you’re drinking, the bottle generates on ongoing hydration status in the form of a percentage
                that’s viewable via the lid — as well as in the app. This indicates your current hydration level based
                on your daily goal that’s calculated given your height and weight.</p>

        <p class="orta-sağ-p"> <b> The Hidrate Spark 2.0 is simple — it works by glowing every <br> time you should be
                drinking
                water. The system calculates your <br> water needs in the companion app based on your height and <br>
                physiology, then
                lights up throughout the day to remind you <br> to take a swig. A Bluetooth-enabled microprocessor
                sensor <br>
                underneath the lid tracks how much you consume while the <br> companion app delivers your stats.

            routinely charge
            it.</p>
        <p class="alt-p2">The 24-ounce bottle, which comes in six color options, syncs with a host of apps and fitness
            <br>
            trackers including the Fitbit Versa, Apple Watch, Apple Health, Google Fit, Under Armour <br> Record, and
            Nokia
            Health Mate. It’s made of BPA-free Tritan plastic and is fully dishwasher safe <br> although the removable
            sensor
            has to be detached each time. Overall, it’s a nice mid-range <br> choice for just $55 that gets the job
            done.

        </h2>
        <p class="alt2-p">Made by the same company as the Bellabeat Leaf fitness tracker, the Spring features a unique
            <br>
            set of body metrics it analyzes to determine your recommended daily water consumption. In <br> addition to
            basic
            info such as your age, height, and weight, it also considers your activity level <br>, local weather, and if
            you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. Though designed with women in mind <br> the 16-ounce water bottle is
            perfectly
            suited for men.
